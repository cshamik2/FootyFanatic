    Aston Villa have agreed to sign Marco Asensio from French champions PSG on loan until the end of the season. 
    
    The 29-year-old Spain international is currently under contract with the Parisians until June 2026.
    
    He has been at PSG since July 2023 when he arrived from Real Madrid.

    Asensio has scored seven goals in 47 appearances for the Ligue 1 club, having netted 61 times in 286 outings for his former side. However, he has been an unused substitute in three of the last four games and PSG are willing to offload him this winter, having offered him around to multiple potential suitors.
    
    Villa are desperate to bolster their attack following the departure of top scorer Jhon Duran to Al Nassr for £65million. 
    
    Following Saturday night's 2-0 defeat by Wolves, Unai Emery insisted that his team needed to make additions before the winter transfer window shuts on Monday.</p>
